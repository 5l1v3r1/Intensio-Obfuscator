# Recommendations
- If `#` (comment) after a line of code, exaemple `test = 'test' # it's a test`, the space betwen the end of code and `#`, is important, otherwise the functionality 'remove' will not work

- All comments between `"""` or `'''` on multiple lines should be exactly as in source code examples.
