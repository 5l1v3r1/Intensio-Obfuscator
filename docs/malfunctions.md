# Malfunctions
- Do not define identically your names of local variables/classes/functions to python keywords or names of functions/classes of imported python libraries.

- If a variable/class/function has an identical name with a word between `' '` or `" "` in `print()` function, your text will have the same value that the mixer variables/class/function.

- If a variable/class/function has an identical name with a word  in after `#` (commentary) your text will have the same value that the mixer variables/class/function.

- If you named your variables/classes/functions in the same way as python keywords or names of functions/class of imported python libraries, an error may appear. Edit `intensio/exclude/python/excluded_python_words.txt` to add the variables not to obfuscate or change your names of local variables/classes/fuctions, if your variables/classes/functions  have the same name as a keyword it, he will be obfuscated and errors will appear.
